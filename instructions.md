Implement responsive images using srcset attribute
Use modern image formats (WebP with JPEG fallback)
Implement lazy loading for images using loading="lazy" attribute
Consider using a CDN for faster image delivery

3.3 Horizontal Scrolling:

Implement efficient scrolling using CSS scroll-snap
Use IntersectionObserver API to load additional content as user scrolls

3.4 Placeholder Images:

Use lightweight SVG placeholders during initial load
Implement progressive image loading for smooth transition


Detailed Component Specifications

4.1 Product Card Component:

Consistent sizing across all sections
Placeholder image with aspect ratio 16:9
Product name: Single line, truncate with ellipsis if too long
Price: Displayed in local currency ($ used in wireframe)
Star rating: Use half-star increments, display average rating

4.2 Category Buttons:

Equal width and height
Use icons to represent categories
Implement hover and active states for better UX

4.3 Search Bar:

Implement autocomplete functionality
Consider adding category filters

4.4 Horizontal Scrolling:

Implement touch-friendly scrolling for mobile devices
Add left/right navigation arrows for desktop


Responsive Design Considerations:


Implement a fluid grid system
Adjust number of visible products based on screen size
Stack sections vertically on mobile devices
Ensure touch-friendly UI elements for mobile users


Accessibility Improvements:


Ensure proper heading hierarchy (h1, h2, etc.)
Add alt text to all images
Implement keyboard navigation for scrolling sections
Ensure sufficient color contrast for text and UI elements

## Product Detail Page Specification

Overview
The product detail page will provide comprehensive information about a specific product on Gumroad. It will be dynamically generated based on the product data stored in IndexedDB.
Page Layout and Structure

2.1 Header

Same as the home page: Gumroad logo, search bar, and "Library" button
Add a "Back to Home" button

2.2 Main Content Area

Product title (h1)
Creator name with link to creator's profile
Product image carousel
Price and purchase button
Star rating and number of reviews
Product description (supports rich text formatting)
File type and size information
Preview button (if applicable)
Social sharing buttons

2.3 Additional Sections

Related products
Creator's other products
Customer reviews and ratings
FAQ section


Dynamic Content Loading

3.1 IndexedDB Integration

Use IndexedDB to store and retrieve product details
Create an object store named "products" with the following structure:

Key: product_id (unique identifier)
Fields: title, creator, price, rating, description, images, file_info, reviews, faq



3.2 Data Fetching and Storage

On first visit to a product page, fetch data from Gumroad API
Store fetched data in IndexedDB for offline access and faster subsequent loads
Implement a background sync to update product data periodically

3.3 Performance Optimization

Load critical product information first (title, main image, price, purchase button)
Lazy load remaining content as user scrolls
Use IndexedDB for faster loading of product details on repeat visits


Detailed Component Specifications

4.1 Product Image Carousel

Support multiple images
Implement touch-friendly swipe gestures
Add zoom functionality for detailed view
Use lazy loading for non-visible images

4.2 Purchase Button

Change state based on product type (e.g., "Buy Now", "Subscribe", "Pre-order")
Integrate with Gumroad's payment system
Show loading state during transaction processing

4.3 Review Section

Display average rating with a breakdown of star distributions
Paginate reviews with "Load More" functionality

Monitor conversion rates and purchase funnel


Security Considerations


Sanitize all user-generated content before rendering
Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) headers
Use HTTPS for all connections
Validate and sanitize data before storing in IndexedDB
